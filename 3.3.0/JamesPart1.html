# Creating server in ubuntu
<b style="margin:0px; padding:0;">This is a personal note to setup server using ubuntu 18.04 WSL, windows 10, using James Apache Server 3.3.0. 

Hopefully in the future can be used again to setup another server or in case of backup server</b>
Guide / Tutorial Based on : 
-http://wiki.107.co.jp/user/sano/letsencrypt
-http://wiki.107.co.jp/user/sano/james_again

in this part 1, we will : 
-Get all the necessary files
-Upload them to our server using SCP
-Accessing our server using ssh
-Unpack / Install all the component and checking if it was correctly installed


# Get the necessary
1. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for windows 10. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab

2. Java SE DevelopmentKit 8u212 for Linux (with tar.gz extension). https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

3. Apache James Server 3.3.0. https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/james/server/3.3.0/james-server-app-3.3.0-app.zip 

4. Private key for our VPS server (I received this one from Mr.Sano, maybe you get it after buying the VPS)

5. Put all files in one directory for easier search (E.X = C:\yourdirectory).

# Setting the environment
1. Install Ubuntu and follow the instruction.
2. Open Ubuntu, you will be asked to create an username first time running Ubuntu.
3. After setting up the username, we will create directory to store private key for use later (Contabo).
```
$sudo mkdir .ssh
```

4. Move the private key to Ubuntu. This private key will be used to access our server.
```
$sudo mv /mnt/c/yourdirectory/contabo /home/jactare/.ssh 
```
Private key is ready to use! (dont forget to check with ls -a)

5. Upload java using the private key to the server.
```
$sudo scp -i .ssh/contabo /mnt/yourdirectory/jdk-8u212-linux-x64.tar.gz [user]@[domainname]:/home/[usernameinserver]
```
if it successfull, it will show the upload progress

6. After java has been uploaded to the server, lets try login to the server (For this tutorial im gonna write using my domain and username).
```
$cd .ssh
$sudo ssh -p 22360 -i contabo jactare@jason.107.jp
```
To summarize, we are connecting through port 22360 and using the private key file named "contabo" to login to the server named jactare@jason.107.jp.

7. after successful login, we can unzip the java file for the server to use.
```
$sudo cd /home/jactare
$sudo tar  -xzf jdk-8u152-linux-x64.tar.gz
$sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm
$sudo mv jdk1.8.0_212 /usr/lib/jvm/
$cd /usr/lib/jvm    
$sudo ln -s jdk1.8.0_212 java-8-oracle-amd64
```
after we unzip it, we create a directory in /usr/lib/jvm and then move the unzipped file into the directory. after we change directory to the newly made directory, we create a hard link for the java, later it will be used to configure our JAVA_PATH.

8. For java to be recognized, we need to set the JAVA_PATH.
```
$cd /home/jactare
$sudo vim .bash_profile
```
To enter insert mode, press "i" and add this information:
```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle-amd64
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
```
to exit insert mode, press "Esc" button and type below to exit and save the changes.
```
:wq!
```
you can check if java id detected by running "echo $JAVA_HOME" and the output will be the folder destination of where the Java JDK unzipped.

9. Now we need to edit permission for our account
```
$sudo vim /etc/sudoers
```
Edit some of the information.
```
Defaults        env_keep += "JAVA_HOME"
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
```
Also add this information under %sudo, so we dont need password to use bash function.
```
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
jactare ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
```

# Getting MySQL

<b>Some function, might be helpful</b>
```
//Mysql Command//
SHOW TABLES FROM [database name]; = show all tables in the databases
SHOW DATABASES; = show all databases
DESCRIBE [table name]; = Show Column name and type of the written tables 
USE [database name]; = refer the database so you dont have to write databasename.tableinside
```

Lets install MySQL, create user and database for our James server.
```
$sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client
//after finish installing//
$sudo mysql
```

Create a Database and a Table first before adding the user :
```
CREATE DATABASE [database name];
CREATE TABLE [table name] (column1,column2,column3,...);
```
These 2 query below will automatically give permission to edit the database named and all its tables while creating the user.
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [database name].* TO '[username]'@'[hostname]' IDENTIFIED BY '[Password]';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [database name].* TO '[username]'@'[hostname]' IDENTIFIED BY '[Password]'; WITH GRANT OPTION;FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Congratulation, we created an user , you can try by exiting Mysql and login to Mysql (sudo mysql -u [username] -p) again using the user you created.

# Setting the James
Now that we already download the James file last time....
1. Exit the server, and upload the james files
```
$exit
//Back to local Ubuntu//
$sudo scp -i .ssh/contabo /mnt/c/james-server-app-3.3.0-app.zip jactare@jason.107.jp:/home/jactare
```

2. Login to the server and unzip and renames the folder.
```
$cd /home/jactare
$unzip james-server-app-3.3.0-app.zip
$mv james-server-app-3.3.0 james3
```
3. Configure James path so ubuntu recognize it.
```
sudo vim .bash_profile
```
Add the information below the java information:
```
export JAMESPATH=$HOME/james3
export PATH=$JAMESPATH/bin:$PATH
```
Save any changes.

# Configurating UFW
UFW is the firewall in ubuntu. we need to allow some port for our email server to receive and send email. So here's what i try :
1. Checking the status of the UFW (Since we never did anything to the UFW, it should say disabled.
```
$sudo ufw status
```
2. Set the ufw default to block all ports, and then allow some port. Port will be used for our email.
```
$sudo ufw default deny
$sudo ufw allow 22 
$sudo ufw allow 80
$sudo ufw allow 443
$sudo ufw allow 22360
$sudo ufw allow 465
$sudo ufw allow 993
$sudo ufw allow 995
$sudo ufw allow 110
$sudo ufw allow 25
$sudo ufw allow 587
$sudo ufw allow 148
$sudo ufw allow 143
$sudo ufw allow 111
```
From what Mr.Sano said : if ssh are not allowed (22) when UFW is enabled, it will never connect and we need to reinstall the Ubuntu, so be carefull when enabling a port
<b>Additional information for what port need to be allowed: </b>
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands

3. Now lets enable the UFW
```
$sudo ufw enable
```
see the status and see if your port was listed
```
sudo ufw status
```

# James Database Configuration
Now we need to configure so our James has database.
```
$vim james3/conf/james-databases.properties
```
Change these : 
- database.username = username that was created last time in MYSQL 
- database.password = username password
- database.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/james3?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&useSSL=false
- database.driverClassName = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
- vendorAdapter.database = MYSQL

Restart the server by running "sudo reboot", just to make sure all the setting are applied.

#Startup the server 
Before we start, there will be some missing files when starting james.

These are the files :
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.39-bin.jar ( Either get this from other server, or you can use the newer version here, i havent tried if it will be successfull https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.zip )
- sunjce_provider.jar (Find them in /javadirectory/jre/lib/ext/ )
- get these 2 files and copy it to jamesdirectory/lib/

After you get all the files, lets try the server.

```
$cd /home/jactare/james3/bin
$james start
$sudo bash run.sh
```

Personally for me, i always take precaution to at least run using james command before executing the above code.

```
$james start
```

to tell if it was successfull you should see at this line :
```
INFO  [time.stamp] | org.apache.james.app.spring.JamesAppSpringMain | Apache James Server is successfully started in 11426 milliseconds.
```

# Important Data about the server

========!!Section still under construction!!===========
PEM file location when Certbot created it :
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/[domain name]/cert.pem
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/[domain name]/fullchain.pem
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/[domain name]/chain.pem
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/[domain name]/privkey.pem

Focus on 2 thing : FullChain and PrivKey Since it was the 2 thing it was mentioned (Maybe it was for the cacerts and keystore file)

link about why SMTP have to be 25 (Still Need Research Since its from 2017, Gonna ask some people on JAMES APACHE)

https://www.mail-archive.com/server-user@james.apache.org/msg15590.html

For Jamer Server Log Testing
INFO  05:45:38,482 | org.apache.james.app.spring.JamesAppSpringMain | Apache James Server is successfully started in 11113 milliseconds.

For using Keytool Sudo for Lets Encrypt:
cd /usr/lib/jvm/

Setting up multiple port for 25 and 465 
https://www.mail-archive.com/server-user@james.apache.org/msg15988.html (need to clean this place up)


Dont forget sudo chmod +x service.sh to allow service to be used on startup by james3.service

For JDKIM still need more research but Mr sano did CHMOD on the files

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR DKIM PURPOSES
<b>(Letsencrypt was used for SSL Certification, NOT for DKIM and SPF Purposes)</b>
